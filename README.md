# AIMA in C++

C++ Implementations of some of the algorithms in [Norvig's](http://www.norvig.com/) [Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach 3rd Edition](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).

## Building

Uses the following system libraries:
* Boost
* SQLite3
* OpenGL
* glfw

Clone the repo recursively and run cmake. Build all or choose which executables you want.

## Running

There are two ways to run the algorithms:
1. Run the integrated app and choose individual applets or demos from the drop down menu.
2. Run the desired app or demo as an independent executable.
